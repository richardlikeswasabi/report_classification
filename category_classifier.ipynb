It was discovered the Potts Hill warehouse AFA fire panel had been activated by the fire pump mtce work. The MMM Fire contractor was with the Potts Hill Thiess Handyman whom was trying to explain the operation of the panel to the BSA (sub/sub contractor).  Triple M fire admitted they had caused the false alarm, saying they didn?t have any training on the Potts Hill fire system, that they were new sub-contractors and there was no handover from the previous supplier. There was no Thiess FM on-site and they had not read the O&amp;M manuals (they just apparently made assumptions on how it operated and went about doing work on the fire pumps).

       "2025  At about 1.37pm the SWC FM Manager was contacted by a Potts Hill site area warden and informed that the Potts Hill Warehouse & Depot Office had been evacuated by the building EWIS.  The main building fire panel was found to be isolated. Thiess Concierge advised that Triple M Fire (a new contractor) were on site undertaking maintenance work. As the fire system was isolated there was effectively no monitoring of automatic monitoring in the main office.   It was discovered the Potts Hill warehouse AFA fire panel had been activated by the fire pump mtce work. The MMM Fire contractor was with the Potts Hill Thiess Handyman whom was trying to explain the operation of the panel to the BSA (sub/sub contractor).  Triple M fire admitted they had caused the false alarm, saying they didn?t have any training on the Potts Hill fire system, that they were new sub-contractors and there was no handover from the previous supplier. There was no Thiess FM on-site and they had not read the O&M manuals (they just apparently made assumptions on how it operated and went about doing work on the fire pumps).  Staff were advised to return to work.   The fire trip also affected in the operation of the Air Con systems (both buildings) and after advising same, Potts Hill Thiess Handyman later re-set the units.

The new RMU was wired correctly and as the works were in a 4M greenfield area, it was decided to match termination as upstream asset (wrong pattern). 4M made a request for switching Instruction for works to carry out on 8th February to SWC. Ventia are the authorised body to complete isolations on behalf of SWC. 4M did not have any works being undertaken in EC7.   On the 8/2/18, Addelec reported to 4M site however switching instructions were yet to be issued by SWC HV team to 4M. This allowed Addelec to work on another job onsite for SWC HV. Once the switching instruction was issued,  there was difference of opinion on where to rectify the wiring. SWC HV Operators elected to rectify at EC7. The formal switching instruction was updated over the phone between SWC HV team and Ventia. Conducting instructions over the phone, is deemed allowable in emergency scenarios. This isn?t deemed an emergency scenario however was the cause of action taken. The switching was completed by Ventia. Addelec accepted the HV access permit to work. Shortly after commencing, worker received a shock, and upon investigation the cable was found to be isolated but not earthed, which is a requirement of the isolation. Earthing the cable would have removed the residual voltage and capacitance in the cable.

       "2592  4Malabar uses Addelec as a subcontractor for HV cabling works. Addelec is also used by Ventia for SW HV works. 4Malabar are installing new Ring Main units in one location (EC5C), it was discovered on the 7th of Feb that an upstream RMU in a different electrical centre(EC7), had a wiring issue. The new RMU was wired correctly and as the works were in a 4M greenfield area, it was decided to match termination as upstream asset (wrong pattern). 4M made a request for switching Instruction for works to carry out on 8th February to SWC. Ventia are the authorised body to complete isolations on behalf of SWC. 4M did not have any works being undertaken in EC7.   On the 8/2/18, Addelec reported to 4M site however switching instructions were yet to be issued by SWC HV team to 4M. This allowed Addelec to work on another job onsite for SWC HV. Once the switching instruction was issued,  there was difference of opinion on where to rectify the wiring. SWC HV Operators elected to rectify at EC7. The formal switching instruction was updated over the phone between SWC HV team and Ventia. Conducting instructions over the phone, is deemed allowable in emergency scenarios. This isn?t deemed an emergency scenario however was the cause of action taken. The switching was completed by Ventia. Addelec accepted the HV access permit to work. Shortly after commencing, worker received a shock, and upon investigation the cable was found to be isolated but not earthed, which is a requirement of the isolation. Earthing the cable would have removed the residual voltage and capacitance in the cable.

       "4281  Electricians were removing a device from the critical bus in UPP2191, and a voltage spike/dip on the 0V caused the local PLC 8 to restart. Once the PLC had powered up it was unable to communicate with its IO. Provecta were called in and due to the unprecedented nature of the problem it took 27hrs to make functional again.

This interrupts the process (which causes supernating and increased FOGs) , and requires operator intervention (to open the covers to hose out the contents in order to be able to spin the basket again). This has happened many times on both new RDTs and the frequency of occurrence is increasing (3 times today, 2/05/18) Bondi WWTP - Multiple RDT drum drive trips requiring operator intervention                                                                "

The electrical isolations were not completed.   It was stated that they did not have to enter the channel, that contractors stood on top of the stop boards in the channel to drill holes. The works were completed under a PTWC and a TRA. The PTWC lists a risk of engulfment and that works must be carried out under a FIFM. The TRA does not mention requirements for working in a confined space, working at heights, working at heights ladder permit, or that Isolation permits or hot work permits are required at the beginning, but does mention that entering the channel is a confined space on later pages. I was told that risk of falling was negated by putting a piece of plywood supported by a wooden beam in place to cover the main gap between the stop boards (put in place by the contractors), and that the other 2 gaps were not big enough to fall through (none of this was in the TRA).  The next work stage was for Screenings Channel 6 to come off line, and it was made clear that the FIFM process needed to be followed, and that the channel could not come offline until screenings channel 5 was completely de-isolated.   While preparing to do the isolations and notifications for the Channel 6 FIFM, I was informed that the stop boards had been removed from channel 5 and put into channel 6. The control room had not been notified of this. Channel 5 had been put back in service on SCADA and Channel 6 placed Out of Service, again without the control room being notified.    While doing the isolations, contractors were already in the channel working. They were sitting on the cross beam while unrestrained, and were cutting the concrete using an angle grinder. The FIFM was not signed off or complete, and the instruction to proceed had not been issued. Malabar WWTP PARR Screenings Channel Work Conducted Without FIFM In Place  58 DROWNING/IMMERSION</td>\n",

       "2324  A FIFM was prepared for Screenings Channel 5 works for PARR. The works were completed on Tuesday without the FIFM being enacted. The tank was isolated and drained. The electrical isolations were not completed.   It was stated that they did not have to enter the channel, that contractors stood on top of the stop boards in the channel to drill holes. The works were completed under a PTWC and a TRA. The PTWC lists a risk of engulfment and that works must be carried out under a FIFM. The TRA does not mention requirements for working in a confined space, working at heights, working at heights ladder permit, or that Isolation permits or hot work permits are required at the beginning, but does mention that entering the channel is a confined space on later pages. I was told that risk of falling was negated by putting a piece of plywood supported by a wooden beam in place to cover the main gap between the stop boards (put in place by the contractors), and that the other 2 gaps were not big enough to fall through (none of this was in the TRA).  The next work stage was for Screenings Channel 6 to come off line, and it was made clear that the FIFM process needed to be followed, and that the channel could not come offline until screenings channel 5 was completely de-isolated.   While preparing to do the isolations and notifications for the Channel 6 FIFM, I was informed that the stop boards had been removed from channel 5 and put into channel 6. The control room had not been notified of this. Channel 5 had been put back in service on SCADA and Channel 6 placed Out of Service, again without the control room being notified.    While doing the isolations, contractors were already in the channel working. They were sitting on the cross beam while unrestrained, and were cutting the concrete using an angle grinder. The FIFM was not signed off or complete, and the instruction to proceed had not been issued. Malabar WWTP PARR Screenings Channel Work Conducted Without FIFM In Place  58 DROWNING/IMMERSION  \n",
       "896   During a safety walk, it was noticed that the fence at the front of the stage 1/2 screenings building which separates the site from the stormwater channel was very low. At barely waist height, the fence would be insufficient to stop a person falling into the channel if they tripped.
